# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN (TensorFlow)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform
multi-class image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow
and Keras. The goal is to build and evaluate a deep learning model capable
of correctly classifying images into one of ten object categories.

This project demonstrates end-to-end deep learning workflow including
data loading, preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Dataset
**CIFAR-10** is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification.
It consists of:
- 60,000 color images of size 32×32
- 10 distinct classes:
  - Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer,
    Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck
- 50,000 training images
- 10,000 test images

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- MaxPooling layers for spatial dimensionality reduction
- Fully connected (Dense) layers for classification
- Softmax activation in the output layer for multi-class prediction

The architecture is designed to balance performance and computational
efficiency for small image inputs like CIFAR-10.

## 🚀 Training Process
- Images are normalized before training
- Categorical cross-entropy is used as the loss function
- Adam optimizer is used for faster convergence
- Model performance is monitored using validation accuracy

---

## 📊 Results
- The trained CNN achieves reasonable accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test set
- The model is able to learn meaningful visual features but shows
  limitations in distinguishing visually similar classes such as
  cats and dogs

*(Exact accuracy may vary depending on training configuration)*

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Apply data augmentation to improve generalization
- Use transfer learning with pretrained models like ResNet50 or MobileNetV2
- Perform hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
- Implement regularization techniques such as Dropout and Batch Normalization
